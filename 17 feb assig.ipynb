    "MongoDB is a non-relational database, also known as a NoSQL database. Non-relational databases are different from traditional relational databases in that they store data in documents instead of tables. This makes them more flexible and scalable than relational databases, allowing them to store more complex data structures and handle larger volumes of data.\n",

    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data structure is complex and/or the data volume is large. Additionally, MongoDB is better suited for applications that require high availability and scalability. It is also better for applications that require real-time analytics or need to store unstructured data."

    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented Storage: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This makes it easier to store and query data, as well as to update and modify it.\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB is designed to be fast and efficient, with a high performance for both reads and writes.\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable, allowing for easy scaling up or down as needed. It also supports sharding, which allows for horizontal scaling.\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: MongoDB has a flexible data model that allows for easy storage of different types of data in the same collection. This makes it easier to store and query data without having to define a schema upfront.\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB provides high availability through replica sets, which provide redundancy and failover capabilities.\n",
    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB has a rich query language that supports complex queries and aggregation operations. This makes it easier to query data and get insights from it."
